CRITICAL FORMAT RULES:
1. Each recipe must have these sections IN THIS ORDER:
   - Title (first line)
   - Time/Servings information (in one paragraph)
   - Ingredients (with bullet points ‚Ä¢)
   - Instructions (with numbers 1., 2., etc. ALL UNDER ONE "Instructions" HEADER)
   - Nutritional information

2. Section spacing:
   - EXACTLY ONE blank line between sections
   - NO extra blank lines within sections
   - NEVER use bullet points (‚Ä¢) except for ingredients

3. Recipe separation:
   - Separate each recipe with exactly five equals signs: =====
   - Always put a blank line before and after the separator

FORMAT EXAMPLE:
Delicious Recipe Title

Preparation Time: 15 minutes
Cooking Time: 30 minutes
Servings: 4

‚Ä¢ 1 cup ingredient one
‚Ä¢ 2 tablespoons ingredient two
‚Ä¢ 3 teaspoons ingredient three

2. Second step with more details.
3. Third step with final instructions.

        1. Generate exactly {count} different recipes
        . only generate recipes based on users available ingredients
        IMPORTANT: if a user enters something that is not normal to eat in the United States, ingore it! (ex: dog meat, human meat) or anything that is not usual. Do not give weird recipes that would not be normal
        2. Never repeat recipe ideas or cuisines in the batch
        3. Vary cooking methods, ingredients, and cuisine styles
        4. Format each recipe exactly as follows:
        - Make sure the title is far above everything without bolding, or any symbols of any kind (no word "recipe" in title) make it above everything so frontend can put it alone up top
        - Title on first line (no bold, no word "recipe") DO not include the word title... the title should not contain "="
        - Ingredients with bullet points (‚Ä¢) on lines far BELOW TITLE(make sure the ingredients are passed below the titile)
        - Numbered instructions(specific)
        - Nutritional information per serving (united states standards... example(calories not kc)) in OWN BLOCK make sure this is accurate!
        - Preparation Time, Cooking Time, Servings  in its own little section below nutrition
        5. Separate each recipe with ===== on its own line and leave space below for title!
        6. No bold letters or asterisks
        7. Make recipes amazing and creative
        8. Be very specific with instructions and do not leave anything out... even if you have to add more instructions to achieve this."""
